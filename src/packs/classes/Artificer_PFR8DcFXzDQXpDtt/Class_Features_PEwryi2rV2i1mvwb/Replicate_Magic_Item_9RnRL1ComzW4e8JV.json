      "value": "<p>You have learned arcane plans that you use to make magic items.</p><h5>Plans Known</h5><p>When you gain this feature, choose four plans to learn from the Magic Item Plans (Artificer Level 2+) table (see the Dungeon Master’s Guide for the items’ descriptions). Bag of Holding, Cap of Water Breathing, Sending Stones, and Wand of the War Mage +1 are recommended. Whenever you gain an Artificer level, you can replace one of the plans you know with a new plan for which you qualify.</p><p>You learn another plan of your choice when you reach certain Artificer levels, as shown in the Plans Known column of the Artificer Features table.</p><h5>Creating an Item</h5><p>When you finish a Long Rest, you can create one or two different magic items if you have Tinker’s Tools in hand. Each item is based on one of the plans you know for this feature.</p><p>If a created item requires Attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you create it. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for Attunement.</p><p>When you reach certain Artificer levels specified in the Magic Items column of the Artificer Features table, the number of magic items you can create at the end of a Long Rest increases. Each item you create must be based on a different plan you know.</p><p>If you try to exceed your maximum number of magic items for this feature, the oldest item vanishes, and then the new item appears.</p><h5>Duration</h5><p>A magic item created by this feature functions exactly like the normal magic item, except its magic isn’t permanent. When you die, the magic item vanishes after 1d4 of days.</p><p>If an item that you created with this feature is a container, such as a Bag of Holding, and it vanishes, its contents harmlessly appear in and around its space.</p>",
